# vmAutomation

This repository is to store some shell scripts and a pdf explaining what they are and how to use them

The purpose of the pdf is to explain the step by step process of automating the
installation of a virtual machine while setting up other aspects of the vm.

The result is a easy guide to quickly set up a VM that is primed for user management,
disk managment, and a general work environment. This can be done in quick amount of time
and even further streamlined for faster automation.
